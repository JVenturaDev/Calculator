# Calculator (Angular Version)

A modern web-based calculator built with **Angular 20.3.7**, designed to provide a complete mathematical workspace.
This version is the **successor** of the original Vite + TypeScript project and is currently being migrated to Angular for improved scalability, modularity, and maintainability.

## Overview

The application currently includes:

* **Basic Calculator** – fully functional.
* **Scientific Calculator** – complete with advanced operations.
* **Sidebar Navigation** – allows switching between calculator modes.
* **Memory and History Modules** – operational and stored via IndexedDB.
* **Graphing Calculator** – under development.
* **Workspace System** – planned for saving, tagging, and organizing full calculations and graphs.

The project is under **active migration and enhancement**, with responsive design and advanced modules being restructured for Angular compatibility.
